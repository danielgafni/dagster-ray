# `RayRunLauncher` + `ray_executor`

The `RunLauncher` is configured in [dagster.yaml](dagster.yaml).

1. Start a local Ray cluster:

```shell
ray start --head
```

2. Start Dagster in the context of this example directory:

```shell
cd examples/run_launcher_and_executor
dagster dev
```

3. From the UI, run the example job and observe how:
- The run is launched via a Ray job.
- The run steps in the run are executed in separate Ray jobs in parallel.
